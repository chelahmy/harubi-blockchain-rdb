# Harubi Front
Harubi Front is a front-end web applications framework based on [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com). It is loosely coupled with harubi back-end. [Harubi](https://github.com/chelahmy/harubi) is all about back-ends. Harubi Front is only a front-end proposal for harubi. And it does not really depend on harubi for back-end. Decoupling front-end and back-end prevents unneeded code fusion, and loosens unnecessary intertwined concerns of development.

React is used for structuring. And Foundation is used for micro-structuring and theming. Analogously, React is used to construct a building, and Foundation is used to finish it. Both of them make a powerful front-end framework. Coupling with harubi [model-action](https://github.com/chelahmy/harubi/tree/master/templates/models) pattern all of them make a great development framework.

React and Foundation: Forms for signing up, signing in and other actions are based on Foundation Form Abide. The top bar and its menus are also based on Foundation. The responsive styling is also based on Foundation. Anything visible is being styled with Foundation. However, underneath all of them is a structure based on crafted React components. Harubi Front development always starts with React structuring.
