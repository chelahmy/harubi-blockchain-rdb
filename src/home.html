<h1>Harubi Front</h1>
<p>Harubi Front is a front-end framework for user-based web applications.
  A Harubi Front app's visitors may sign up as users. And a user must sign in to
  access authenticated areas. The menus for signing up and signing in are made
  prominent on the home page to indicate a user-based web application. Menus
  are important in Harubi Front, and they are associated with actions in the

  model-action</a> pattern. Menus are kept minimal according to the pages a
  user is on.</p>
<p>Harubi Front is based on
  <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and
  <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. It is loosely coupled
  with harubi back-end.
  <a href="https://github.com/chelahmy/harubi">Harubi</a> is all about
  back-ends. Harubi Front is only a front-end proposal for harubi. And it does
  not really depend on harubi for back-end. Decoupling front-end and back-end
  prevents unneeded code fusion, and loosens unnecessary intertwined concerns
  of development.</p>
<p>React is used for structuring. And Foundation is used for micro-structuring
  and theming. Analogously, React is used to construct a building, and
  Foundation is used to finish it. Both of them make a powerful front-end
  framework. Coupling with harubi model-action pattern all of them make a
  great development framework.</p>
<p>Forms for signing up, signing in and other actions are based on Foundation
  Form Abide. The top bar and its menus are also based on Foundation. The
  responsive styling is also based on Foundation. Anything visible is being
  styled with Foundation. However, underneath all of them is a structure based
  on crafted React components. Harubi Front development always starts with
  React structuring.</p>
