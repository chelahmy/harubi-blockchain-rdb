<h1>Harubi Front</h1>
<p>Harubi Front is a front-end framework based on
  <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and
  <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. This front-end is
  loosely coupled with harubi back-end.
  <a href="https://github.com/chelahmy/harubi">Harubi</a> is all about
  back-ends. Harubi does not dictate on front-end. This front-end framework
  is just a proposal for harubi. Anyone can come up with different front-ends
  for harubi. On the other hand, Harubi Front does not have to use harubi as
  back-end. Decoupling front-end and back-end prevents code fusion, which
  loosens concerns of development.</p>
